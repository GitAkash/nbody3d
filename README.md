# N-body problem in 3D

I decided to build a simulation of the N-body problem, this is because i want to learn python and love see physics simulated! It is my second project simulating a physics related phenomenon. 

By appending a particle to the par list you can add more particles to the system. When changing the G in the Particle class you can simulate different gravitational constants.

An animation of the simulation can be seen below.
